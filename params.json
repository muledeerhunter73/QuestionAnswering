{"name":"Middle School Question Solver","tagline":"","body":"# Can a Computer Be Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?\r\n### Introduction\r\nTo learn more about the AI field of natural language processing, I created a website that uses nlp tools and techniques to process a middle school exam history question and try to find the article with the answer on Wikipedia. \r\n\r\n### So What is This?\r\nThis is a question answering system for middle school exam questions.  It specifically seeks to find answers to who, where and when questions. It is put together on an interactive website for users to access. The link to the website is included below. [muledeerhunter73.pythonanywhere.com](http://muledeerhunter73.pythonanywhere.com). \r\n\r\n### Why did I do this?\r\nNatural Language Processing fascinates me in that it allows computers in a sense to understand humans. I did this project to get my toes in the water of how natural language processing works.  Answers to middle school exam questions are abundant on the web, but they can be difficult to find in all the web content.  I decided to do this to try to get the computer to find the answer for me.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGitHub Profile Name: muledeerhunter73\r\nHadley Westover\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
