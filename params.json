It specifically seeks to find answers to who, where and when questions.  It is implemented on the website [muledeerhunter73.pythonanywhere.com(http://muledeerhunter73.pythonanywhere.com). \r\n\r\n### Why did I do this?\r\nNatural Language Processing fascinates me in that it allows computers in a sense to understand humans. I did this project to get my toes in the water of how natural language processing works.  Answers to middle school exam questions are abundant on the web, but it can be difficult to find them in all the content. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGitHub Profile Name: muledeerhunter73\r\nHadley Westover\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
